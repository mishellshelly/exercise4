<p><font size="4"> Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town of Maine where she grew up-- she graduated college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily, but Ryle's complete aversion to replationships is disturbing. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan-- her frist love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threathened.

<p><font size="4"> Lily and Ryle have just settles into a civil co-parenting rhythm with their daughter, Emerson, when Lily suddenly runs into Atlas nearly two years after they last spoke. Elated that the timing finally seems to be right to give what they have together a real chance, Atlas asks Lily on a date. But Lily's excitement is almost immediately replaces by the dread and anxiety when Lily remembers that ryle, though no longer her husband, is still very much part of her life. And though Ryle would dislike Lily dating anyone but him, Atlas Corrigan is the one man he absolutely will not stand in his ex-wife and daughter's lives.
